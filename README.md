# React Starter Projects

This repository contains a variety of React projects created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The master branch is the default initialisation of Create React App. Each of the other branches include a mini project of their own, using the React framework.

## Motivation

These projects were created to help me understand and get comfortable with React, by applying the theory I had learned practically.

## Demo

A live demo of each of these projects can be viewed here. Alternatively, you can run it in your own development environment by following the steps below, if you wish.

## Installation/Usage

If you would like to get this project running in your development environment:

- Make sure that you have Node and NPM installed on your machine.
- Clone the repository with the terminal window.
- `cd` into the repo.
- Navigate to the project(branch) you wish to view with `git checkout origin/<branch-name>`. You can get a list of all the branches available with `git branch -a`.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` to start the development server.

This repository was possible thanks to [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga), who produced a course that helped me to grasp the basics of React.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
