# React Starter Projects

This repository contains a variety of React projects created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The master branch is the default initialisation of Create React App. Each of the other branches include a mini project of their own, using the React framework.

## Motivation

These projects were created to help me understand and get comfortable with React, by applying the theory I had learned practically.

## Demo

A live demo of each of these projects can be viewed here. Alternatively, you can run it in your own development environment by following the steps below, if you wish.

## Installation/Usage

- Make sure that you have Node and NPM installed on your machine.
- Clone the repository with the terminal window.

- Navigate to the project(branch) you wish to view with `git checkout origin/<branch-name>`. You can get a list of all the branches available with `git branch -a`.
